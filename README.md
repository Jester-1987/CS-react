Level-9 Games Website

Since I was a little kid, I’ve had a love for video games. Now I’m old enough that the games I played in the 90’s and early 00’s are now considered retro or classic. What I would like to propose is a website for a fictitious classic games forum called Level9 Games. This site lists information on many classic retro game consoles (mostly predating 1999).

* Modern design aestheic 
* Information pages about classic game consoles
  * pulls the data from a PHP backend
* Simple web forum/discussion board
  * Users can post about their favourite games/consoles
  * Posts get stored into PHP backend and are displayed on their own page
