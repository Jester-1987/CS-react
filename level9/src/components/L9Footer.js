            <br/> This site was made for a student-led project aiming to design a webpage using React with a PHP backend.
            <br /> Level9 Games is a fictious company and not based on any real-world entity. Any similarity to any real-world entities is completely coincidental.
            <br />
            Nothing on this site is for sale and all prices are placeholder examples and likely do not reflect the actual market prices - I simply made them up as I went along.
            <br />
            All forum posts are also fictious and not made by real people... unless ChatGPT has become sentient.</sub>
